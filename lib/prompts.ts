export const CODE_FROM_VIDEO_PROMPT = `You are an expert frontend developer and instructional designer, specializing in creating engaging, interactive learning experiences via single-file HTML web apps.

Your task is to create the complete HTML code for an interactive web app based on the provided video details.
Video Title: {VIDEO_TITLE}
Video URL (for context, do not attempt to access directly for this task): {VIDEO_URL}

The web app should:
1.  Be a single, self-contained HTML document. All CSS styles and JavaScript code must be inline within <style> and <script> tags respectively. Do not use external files.
2.  Be fully responsive and function correctly on both desktop and mobile devices.
3.  Feature a core interactive element directly related to the main topic or key concepts of the video. This interaction should allow users to actively engage with the material.
4.  Clearly explain the key principles or concepts from the video. The app must incorporate elements that provide detailed step-by-step explanations. This could be through guided interactive steps, tooltips, modal popups, or dedicated explanatory text sections within the app. The goal is to make the learning process self-explanatory and thorough.
5.  Have a clean, modern, and accessible visual design. Use ARIA attributes where appropriate for accessibility.
6.  Be simple enough in scope that its core functionality can be understood and implemented robustly in a single HTML file. Focus on quality over quantity of features.
7.  The primary goal is to enhance understanding of the video's topic through playful and effective design.
8.  Ensure the <html> and <body> tags, and any main app wrapper, are styled to occupy the full 100% height and width of the viewport (iframe). Specifically, the <html> and <body> elements should have \`height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0;\`. If a primary wrapper div is used, it should also be styled to expand and fill the body (e.g., using \`display: flex; flex-direction: column; min-height: 100vh;\` or appropriate flex properties for its children like \`height: 100%;\`).

Provide ONLY the HTML code for the web app. Encase the complete HTML code between "${CODE_REGION_OPENER}" and "${CODE_REGION_CLOSER}" for easy parsing.
Example structure:
${CODE_REGION_OPENER}

<html lang="en" style="height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

        body { 
            font-family: sans-serif; 
            margin: 0; /* Ensure no default margin */
            padding: 0; /* Ensure no default padding */
            height: 100%; /* Make body take full height of html element */
            display: flex; /* Optional: if you want a flex container for direct children */
            flex-direction: column; /* Optional: if body is a flex container */
        }
        /* Example for a main wrapper div if you use one */
        .app-container {
            flex-grow: 1; /* Allows it to take available space if body is flex */
            height: 100%; /* Or this, depending on parent setup */
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            /* Add other styles for your main container */
        }
        .interactive-element { border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; }
    </style>
</head>
<body style="height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0;">

//SPEC_FROM_VIDEO_PROMPT, SPEC_ADDENDUM, and CONCEPT_OUTLINE_PROMPT are no longer used for video-to-app mode.
// Kept here for reference or if other functionalities might use them in the future.

export const SPEC_FROM_VIDEO_PROMPT = \`You are a pedagogist and product designer with deep expertise in crafting engaging learning experiences via interactive web apps.

Your task is to design an interactive web app based on the concept of a video.
Video Title: {VIDEO_TITLE}
Video URL (for context, do not attempt to access directly for this task): {VIDEO_URL}

Write a detailed and carefully considered spec for this interactive web app. The app should complement the video on its topic and reinforce its key idea(s).

Example of a spec (for a generic topic, adapt for the specific video content):
"In music, chords create expectations of movement. This relates to Functional Harmony.
Build an interactive web app based on the video's content.
SPECIFICATIONS:
1. The app must feature an interactive element relevant to the video's main topic.
2. The app must explain key principles of the video's topic as conceptually covered.
3. The app must align with general learning objectives for understanding the video's core concepts.
[etc.]"

The goal of the app is to enhance understanding of the video's topic through simple, playful, and effective design. The spec should not be overly complex. A junior web developer should be able to implement it in a single HTML file (inline styles/scripts). The spec must clearly outline core mechanics effective for reinforcing the key idea(s) from the video.
Crucially, the app's design must incorporate elements that provide detailed step-by-step explanations of the core concepts from the video. This could be through guided interactive steps, tooltips, or dedicated explanatory text sections within the app. The goal is to make the learning process self-explanatory and thorough.
The spec must be thorough yet concise. Aim for a specification that is detailed enough for a junior developer but ideally under 1500 words (which is approximately 2000 tokens) to ensure efficient processing for subsequent code generation. Focus on the core interactive elements and learning objectives.

Provide the result as a JSON object containing a single field called "spec", whose value is the text of the spec for the web app.
\`;

export const SPEC_ADDENDUM = \`\n\nThe app must be fully responsive and function properly on both desktop and mobile. Provide the code as a single, self-contained HTML document. All styles and scripts must be inline. In the result, encase the code between "${CODE_REGION_OPENER}" and "${CODE_REGION_CLOSER}" for easy parsing. Ensure the HTML is well-structured, accessible, and includes clear visual design.\`;


export const CONCEPT_OUTLINE_PROMPT = \`You are an expert in structuring educational content.
Based on the following video information:
Video Title: {VIDEO_TITLE}
Video URL (for context only): {VIDEO_URL}

Create a hierarchical textual outline of the main concepts and sub-topics related to the video's title and URL.
If the title and URL are too generic, generate a generic concept outline for a common educational topic.
Use markdown for the outline (e.g., using '-' or '*' for bullet points and indentation for hierarchy).
For each point in the outline, provide a brief (1-2 sentence) elaboration or explanation that offers more context or detail, making the outline itself a richer learning aid.
The outline should be clear, concise, and help a student see the 'big picture'.

Example for a video on "Basic Algebra":
{
  "outline": "- Basic Algebra: This branch of mathematics deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols, forming a foundation for more advanced mathematical concepts.\n  - Variables and Expressions: These are fundamental building blocks for representing quantities and relationships in a symbolic way.\n    - Definition of a variable: A symbol (often a letter like x or y) that represents a quantity that can change, is unknown, or can take on different values within a set.\n    - Forming algebraic expressions: Combining variables, numbers (constants), and mathematical operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to represent mathematical phrases or calculations.\n  - Solving Equations: This involves finding the specific value(s) of the variable(s) that make a mathematical statement of equality true.\n    - Linear equations: Equations where the highest power of the variable is 1 (e.g., ax + b = c). Their graphs are straight lines.\n    - Simple quadratic equations: Equations where the highest power of the variable is 2 (e.g., ax^2 + bx + c = 0). Their graphs are parabolas."

Return the outline as JSON object with a single key "outline" which contains the textual outline string.
If no outline can be generated, return an empty string for "outline".
